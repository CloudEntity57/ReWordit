This is an expanded thesaurus app that takes a string as input and inserts random synonyms for every word in the string. The app can recognize the part of speech of every word, allowing the user to control which types of words are reassigned synonyms or not.

For example: the user can check only adjectives, and as a result all nouns, verbs and adverbs in the string will remain unchanged.
